Code plan:

To render a gantt chart
Take all tasks from DB, each task has a name, start date and end date.
Order tasks by end date.
Render task as bar on calendar (length of bar = end date-start date, turn into integer and then use as pixel width, height constant)
For each task in array tasks: Move down and render next task.


To take saved projects:

Choose user - click on the chart type, choose either new or the saved project

So each project will have a set number of tasks

DB:

Project
ProjectID, ProjectName, ChartTypeID, UserID

Task
TaskID, TaskName, StartDate, EndDate, ProjectID

ChartType
ChartTypeID, ChartName 

User
UserID, Username
